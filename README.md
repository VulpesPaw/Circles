# Circles - Dynamic Archery Targets

## ABOUT

The Circles Software is meant to be a form of archery practice. By paring the software with a projector, thus mirroring the screen onto a wall, an archer can unleash an arrow a the circular target. With the target appearing in at an unknown time, in an unknown place, with an unknown size. With these in mind, it will prove to be good practice for the instinctive longbow archer.

## Documentation & How to use

Setup can be seen in the word documents included in the repo. This program is not limited by different screen resolutions, thus if mirroring a projector screen this program will still be usable.

## Notes

This was my exam project for programing C# year 1, 2020. There are a lot of things I would do differently if I were to create this program today.
